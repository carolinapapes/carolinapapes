## Hi there!

Iâ€™m Carolina, also known as capapesâ€”a graphic designer and front-end developer with 4 years of experience. I'm currently improving my coding skills at 42 School Barcelona while working as a freelancer on Upwork. Iâ€™m always looking for new projects to collaborate on, and I love bringing creative ideas to life!
